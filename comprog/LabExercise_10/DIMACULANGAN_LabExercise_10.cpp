/* Word/char counter by [Dimaculangan, Gionne Ni√±o P.] of BSIT-1B.
 * [2024 - 11 - 13]
 *
 * Input sentence is moved into a buffer string object, then the buffer
 * is validated and guaranteed (hopefully) to contain at least a char.
 * Each char in the buffer is checked to be whitespace. If not, the char 
 * is pushed into the latest pushed string object in the "words" vector.
 * If it is whitespace, a new empty string is pushed into "words". This
 * loops until the end of the buffer.
 *
 * Word count is measured by the length of the "words" buffer, and char
 * count is measured by how many times a char was pushed into a string
 * in "words".*/
