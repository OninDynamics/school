 * Description:
 * 		A quiz program. Dynamically computes scores based on
 * 		question set, as defined by the vector<QuizItem> quiz.
 *
 * 		Extremely easy to modify question set. Handles user
 * 		input without errors.
 *
 * 		Designed for quadruple-choice questions only.
 *
 * 		I managed to get this to work perfectly on first compile.
 * 		Granted, it took me 1 hour to get the code to a compile-able
 * 		state. I guess this is what happens when someone obsessively
 * 		cares about "correctness", i.e. is a Rust/Functional
 * 		programmer. Anywho, I shouldn't toot my horn THIS much...
