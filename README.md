# Onin's School Code

You may view my code in GitHub, by using the file/folder links above.

If you have any problems, do [e-mail](mailto://onindynamics@pm.me) or DM me (if you somehow have my DM xD).

Everything here is in the public domain. I think. There might be a few files that end up here that shouldn't be in the public domain, so please point it out in [the Issues page](https://github.com/OninDynamics/school/issues) before I get sued :(
